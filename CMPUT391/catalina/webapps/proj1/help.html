<h1>Radiology Information System by Alice Wu</h1>
<p><ur>The Radiology Information System (RIS) is a web-based database application system, which resembles the real life radiology information system.</ul></p>
<p><ul>A Radiology Information System (RIS) is a computer information system that stores and processes the information for a radiology lab, including all the data regarding patients, and all medical images generated by various diagnostic and therapeutic equipments, such as X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT/CAT), Ultrasound (US), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A Radiology Information System is optimally complemented with a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).</ul></p>
<p><ul>In general, the digital images generated by radiology equipments shall be in the format of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). (DICOM is the industry standard for transferal of radiologic images and other medical information between computers.) For this project, however, a jpg format will be used instead.</ul></p>
